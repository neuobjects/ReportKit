/**
 The `RKReportDataSource` protocol defines a set of methods to be used to populate a report.
 
 > Important: Most of these methods are @optional. For some reason, DocC is marking many of the optional methods as _Required_. The only required methods are the following:
 
 ### Required Methods
 `func numberOfReportEntries(for: RKPageTemplate!) -> Int`

 `func report(RKReport!, numberOfGroupRowsIn: RKReportGroup!) -> Int`
 
 `func report(RKReport!, numberOfDetailRowsIn: RKReportGroup!) -> Int`

 */

@protocol RKReportDataSource <NSObject>

/**
 Return the number of records for the given page template
 @param pageTemplate The design-time page template of the report getting produced.
 @return The number of records that will be printed for this report.
 @discussion A report is driven off a primary record. The report can then include additional information relataed to this record. For example, an invoice for a single customer will have 1 primary record. That invoice may have a number of line items. When generating several invoices, you have a couple options: By specifying the number of invoices to this method, you will end up with a single invoice report that contains all invoices. Alternatively, you can specify 1 as the number of primary records and generate the report once for each invoice you would like to generate.
 
 When a report has 0 primary records, the report will still generate with the Report and Page header and footer bands.

 @discussion This method is called when a group is about to get generated. The `RKReportGroup` as two properties you can associate data with - `groupObject` and `groupContentObjects`. The `groupObject` is typically a single record or dictionary that's associated with this group. The `groupContentObjects` should be an array of objects. When it's time for the the reporting engine to map values into the band components, you can refer to these properties in the datasource methods that asks for them. These properties are especially useful for reports having multiple groups.
