/**
 The clamping location defines the behavior of the component if the band is resized during the generation process.
 @discussions Text field and text view components may be resized to account for the size of their content. If a band is resized, the reporting engine will use this property to position the component on the band. Components that are set to clamp to the top will retain the spacing to the top of the band. Likewise, components that are set to clamp to the bottom will retain the spacing to the bottom of the resized band.
